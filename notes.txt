Things to consider when adding score considerations into the getEstimatedPoints function:
  1.  North-south has 90 partial, north opens One Heart, if east and south pass, we can't say anything about souths points score


  2.  Estimated Point Counts with Game Bid off a partial
    biddingRelative = {
        "left": ['pass', 'Two Heart'],
        "top": ['One Spade', 'pass'],
        "right": ['pass', 'pass'],  <---------------------- if 'lefts' bid is a game bid, right's 2nd pass  
        "bottom": ['pass'],                           shouldn't bring the max down to 6 like it   
                                                            normally would
    }

    in general:  if a player's partner makes game bid, any pass by that player doesn't change the min/max.
