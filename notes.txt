Things to consider when adding score considerations into the getEstimatedPoints function:
  1.  North-south has 90 partial, north opens One Heart, if east and south pass, we can't say anything about souths points score


  2.  Estimated Point Counts with Game Bid off a partial
    biddingRelative = {
        "left": ['pass', 'Two Heart'],
        "top": ['One Spade', 'pass'],
        "right": ['pass', 'pass'],  <---------------------- if 'lefts' bid is a game bid, right's 2nd pass  
        "bottom": ['pass'],                           shouldn't bring the max down to 6 like it   
                                                            normally would
    }

    in general:  if a player's partner makes game bid, any pass by that player doesn't change the min/max.

  3. Is three diamond overcall indicitave of higher min points or just to prevent the other team from going out?
    biddingRelative = {
        "left": ['Pass', 'Two No Trump'],
        "top": ['Two Diamond', 'Three Diamond'],
        "right": ['Two Heart', 'pass'],
        "bottom": ['pass'],
    }


Overall functions test cases:
  -No biddable suit and team bids your closest to biddable suit:
   biddingRelative = {
        "left": ['pass'],
        "top": ['pass'],
        "right": ['One Heart'],  
        "bottom": [],         
    }
    expected = "double"
    handDictionary = {
      "clubs": "54",
      "diamonds": "974",
      "hearts": "AQJT9",
      "spades": "AQ9",
    }
