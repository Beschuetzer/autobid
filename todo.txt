-Need to adjust how HCP and dist points are counted
  if partner has not opened, pick the best suit and get points based on that
  if partner has opened, calculate dist points based the contract being in the suit your partner mentioned (3 of that suits adds 1, 4 adds 2 pts, etc.); also count all hcp rather than just covered ones as your partner likely has stoppers too?
